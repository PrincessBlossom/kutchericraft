What is KatcheriCraft?
KatcheriCraft is a website that helps musicians plan the songs to perform in Carnatic music concerts.
When musicians give a Carnatic concert (aka katcheri), they have to choose which songs to sing/play, in a certain order, with diverse ragas (melodic scales and frameworks), talas (time signatures), tempos, composers, and languages. For new performers or students, it’s a lot to keep track of — and easy to feel unsure about whether the list “works.”

KatcheriCraft makes it easier.

Why is this needed?
Right now, most people either write their concert lists on paper, use a spreadsheet or document, or just keep them in their head.
But that doesn’t tell you if you’ve used the same raga twice, put a certain song in the wrong spot, or lack enough variety: things that can really make or break a concert.
KatcheriCraft checks everything for you and even gives you suggestions to improve.

What rules does it check?
There’s a traditional format that most Carnatic concerts follow. It was created in the 20th century by a legendary musician named Ariyakkudi Ramanuja Iyengar. He figured out how to make Carnatic concerts more enjoyable to the audience by mixing heavy pieces, light pieces, short ones, and long ones in just the right order, as well as making sure concerts don’t get too repetitive.

Less effective concert list:
Two songs in Kalyani — both pieces sound similar, so the concert may feel repetitive
Thillana at the beginning — this is usually a closing item, so starting with it can feel out of place
Several Tyagaraja krithis in a row — even if they’re great, too many by one composer may feel unbalanced if it is not a specifically themed concert
All songs are slow tempo — without tempo changes, the concert might feel heavy or boring

More effective concert list:
Starts with a varnam — a short, energetic piece to warm up and grab attention
Has a main piece in a big raga like Kambhoji or Bhairavi — these allow for deeper improvisation and are usually the highlight
Includes some shorter, lighter pieces near the end — like thillanas or javalis, which are more lyrical and easier to enjoy casually
Mixes different composers, speeds, and ragas — this keeps the audience engaged and makes the concert feel well-rounded

KatcheriCraft helps people stick to that format.
